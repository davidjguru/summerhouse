# Summer House 

Summer House is sandbox for Drupal Decoupled projects. This was created to facilitate on-boarding processes in headless projects of complex architectures, as a starting material to test all the most important aspects of this type of installations. But remember: **It should only be used for training purposes in local development environments**.  
One more time: **Please avoid deploying this project in production environments** or with output to the Internet.  

## 0. TL;DR

You can use SummerHouse in Linux environments, just by doing a local copy and then launch the platform using [DDEV, the containerization tool based in Docker](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). As **prerequisites**, You just need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and DDEV ([Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/), [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)) installed on your system. 


```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/davidjguru/summerhouse.git
$ cd summerhouse
$ ddev start
```
And the project will be loaded, configured, enabled and deployed in your local environment. You will see the main URLs opening in your browser.
